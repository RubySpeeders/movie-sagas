# Project Name

Movie Database Project

## Description

_Duration: 2 days_

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I built a movie database which shows movies in the database on a homepage. By clicking on a poster, the user is brought to a details page where the description and genres of that particular movie is shown. The user can also add a movie to the database.

## Prerequisites

Node.js
React
Redux
Postgresql
Express
Axios
pg
React-Redux
Redux-Saga
Material-UI
react-router-dom

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Click on a poster on the homepage to see the details about that movie.
2. Click on "Add Movie" to add a movie to the database!
